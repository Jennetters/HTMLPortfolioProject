		<h3>Skills and Experience</h3>
		<p>Though my education was centered around Environmental Sciences, I discovered I had a passion for software testing while working with Waterloo Hydrogeologic, a company that develops groundwater modeling software applications, and have since transitioned to a full-time software tester.</p>
		<p>In my time as a software tester over the past 7 years I have gained experience in both automation and manual testing using a variety of applicaitons. I've also had the chance to expand my knowledge and skillset as related to testing. Some of these skills include:</p>
		<ul><li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>Javascript</li>
		<li>Python</li>
		</ul>
